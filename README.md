## Project 7: Advanced CV with Transfer Learning & Deployment

This is the capstone project of my computer vision learning path. I implemented **transfer learning**, the state-of-the-art technique for image classification, to significantly improve performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

I used the pre-trained **MobileNetV2** model, froze its base layers, and trained a custom classification head. The final model was then saved and deployed as an interactive web application using Gradio.

* **Model Used:** Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2
* **Final Accuracy on Test Set:** 79.24% (a 6%+ improvement over the custom CNN)
* **Tools:** TensorFlow, Keras, Gradio, Python

### Key Skills Demonstrated:
* **Transfer Learning:** Implementing a pre-trained model (MobileNetV2) to solve a custom problem.
* **Model Saving & Loading:** The professional workflow of training a model once and saving it for later use in deployment.
* **Interactive Deployment:** Building a user-friendly web interface with Gradio for real-time inference on user-uploaded images.
